## Introduction
This project is a basic recipe website built as part of an HTML practice exercise. The goal is to strengthen foundational HTML skills by creating and structuring a multi-page site with links, images, headings, lists, and paragraphs.

## Skills Demonstrated
By completing this project, I will have:
- Created and organized multiple HTML files.
- Used semantic tags like `h1`, `p`, `ul`, `ol`, and `a`.
- Structured content effectively for readability and usability.
- Managed the project with Git and published it on GitHub.
