        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This easy slow cooker 4-ingredient potato soup uses garlic and herb cheese spread and potatoes O'Brien with onions and peppers to build flavor without increasing prep time. It's a great addition to your soup season repertoire.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound bacon</li>
            <li>2 (28 ounce) bag potatoes O'Brien with onions and peppers</li>
            <li>3.75 pounds chicken broth</li>
            <li>1 pounds garlic and herb cheese spread</li>
            <li>2 pinches black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels; chop roughly when cool enough to handle.</li>
            <li>Working in batches, pour potatoes into the same skillet, and cook until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Remove potatoes to a slow cooker. Stir in chicken broth. Dollop cheese spread on top; scatter bacon on top. Cover slow cooker and cook on High until potatoes are very tender, 3 to 4 hours.</li>
            <li>If desired, ladle some of the soup, no more than halfway full, into a high powered blender. Cover and hold lid down with a potholder; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend, about 45 seconds.</li>
            <li>Pour soup back into slow cooker. Stir to combine; serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
